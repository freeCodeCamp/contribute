# Contribute

> Documentation site for all things contributions. Begin your contribution journey here.

Welcome to the repository for freeCodeCamp.org's "Contribute" website.

This is the place where you can find information about how to contribute to freeCodeCamp, as well as the code for the website itself. This website is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) with the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) theme, deployed on Cloudflare Pages. The goal is to make this a one-stop shop for all things related to contributing to freeCodeCamp.

Here's a Project Board: https://github.com/orgs/freeCodeCamp/projects/40 that shows the current status of the project.

If you're looking for opportunities to contribute to this project, look for help wanted issues in the [issues tab](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/contribute/issues).
