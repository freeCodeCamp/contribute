Welcome to the repository for freeCodeCamp.org's "Contribute" website.

This is the place where you can find information about how to contribute to freeCodeCamp, as well as the code for the website itself. This website is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern static site generator. The goal is to make this a one-stop-shop for all things related to contributing to freeCodeCamp.

Here's a Project Board: https://github.com/orgs/freeCodeCamp/projects/40 that shows the current status of the project.

If you're looking for opportunities to contribute to this project, look for help wanted issues in the [issues tab](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/contribute/issues).

> [!WARNING]
> This repository is under a heavy refactoring/development phase. We are building out a brand-new experience for our contributors. Please get in touch over on our discord: https://chat.freecodecamp.org if you have any questions or need help.
