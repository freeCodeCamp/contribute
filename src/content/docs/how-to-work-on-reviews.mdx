The reviews summarise the topics introduced in the corresponding chapter or module. Some modules could have more than one review depending on how they are structured.

The concepts in a review should follow this pattern.

````md
- **some topic**: some explanation

```
some code here if necessary
```
````

The metadata for reviews require a `blockType` property with a value of `review`, and a `blockLayout` with a value of `link`.
