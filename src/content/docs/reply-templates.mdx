## Build Error

```markdown
Hey @username

We would love to be able to merge your changes but it looks like there is an error with the CI build. ⚠️

Once you resolve these issues, we will be able to review your PR and merge it. 😊

---

Feel free to reference the [contributing guidelines](/how-to-work-on-coding-challenges/#testing-challenges) for instructions on running the CI build locally. ✅
```

## Syncing Fork

> When PR is not up to date with the `main` branch.

````markdown
Hey @username

We would love to be able to merge your changes, but it looks like the branch is not up to date. ⚠️

To resolve this error, you will have to sync the latest changes from the `main` branch of the `freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp` repo.

Using the command line, you can do this in three easy steps:

```bash
git remote add upstream git://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp.git

git fetch upstream

git pull upstream main
```

If you're using a GUI, you can simply `Add a new remote...` and use the link `git://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp.git` from above.

Once you sync your fork and pass the build, we will be able to review your PR and merge it. 😊

---

Feel free to reference the ["Syncing a fork"](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) article on GitHub for more insight on how to keep your fork up-to-date with the upstream repository. 🔄
````

## Merge Conflicts

> When PR has merge conflicts that need to be resolved.¹

```markdown
Hey @username

We would love to be able to merge your changes, but it looks like you have some merge conflicts. ⚠️

Once you resolve these conflicts, we will be able to review your PR and merge it. 😊

---

If you're not familiar with the merge conflict process, feel free to look over GitHub's guide on ["Resolving a merge conflict"](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github/). 🔍️

Also, it's good practice on GitHub to write a brief description of your changes when creating a PR. 📝
```

¹ If a first-time-contributor has a merge conflict, maintainers will resolve the conflict for them.

## Duplicate

> When PR is repetitive or a duplicate.

```markdown
Hey @username

This PR seems to make similar changes as the existing PR <#number>. As such, we are going to close this as a duplicate.

If you feel you have additional changes to expand upon this PR, please feel free to push your commits and request this PR be reopened.

Thanks again! 😊

## Adding Comment About Newbie Mistakes

```markdown
Hello,

Firstly, thank you for submitting this pull request!

As you navigate through the process, we have a PR checklist to ensure consistency and quality in our contributions. We kindly ask that you genuinely follow through with each point. This not only facilitates the review process but also demonstrates a mutual respect for the community's efforts.

If you're unfamiliar with certain aspects, our [contributing guidelines](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org) are a helpful resource to get you up to speed.

<details>
<summary>**Friendly Pointers (click to expand)**</summary>

<Steps>

1. **Editing on GitHub:** While it's possible to edit files directly on GitHub, it's typically better not to. This helps avoid inadvertent mistakes like typos that can disrupt tests.
2. **Pull Request Title:** Please ensure the PR title follows [our convention](/how-to-open-a-pull-request/#prepare-a-good-pr-title).
3. **Linking Issues:** Please ensure you link issues using the designated method. Simply update the `XXXXXX` in the PR description to include the issue number. This keeps our records organized and clear.
4. **Engaging with the Team:** We know you're eager, but kindly keep mentions and review requests limited. Our maintainers are always on the lookout and will attend to PRs in the order they come in.
5. **Branch Management:** It's a good practice not to work directly off your `main` branch. Creating separate branches for different changes allows you to smoothly update your PR even as the main repository progresses.

</Steps>

</details>

Please note, there's no need to close this PR. If you have questions or need guidance refining your contribution, don't hesitate to ask. Our community is here to assist.

Thank you for your enthusiasm in contributing to our project. We eagerly await more contributions from you!

**Happy Contributing!** 🌟
