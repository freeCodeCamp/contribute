Our core instructional content is located within the conveniently named `curriculum` directory. This page will break down how these files are organized.

## Terminology

There are a few terms we use when discussing our curriculum content.

- `certification` : When referring to a certification in this instance, it is talking about the actual certificate that users claim. Which is separate from the name of the superBlock.
- `superBlock` : A superblock is the top level collection of challenges. Each superblock corresponds to a certification in the curriculum (e.g. Responsive Web Design).
- `block` : A block is a section within a superblock. A block corresponds to a group of challenges in a given certification (e.g. Basic HTML and HTML5)
- `challenge` : A challenge is a single lesson within the curriculum (e.g. Say Hello to HTML Elements)

## File Tree

Using those terms, here is how the file structure would be defined:

```md
curriculum/
├─ challenges/
│ ├─ english/
│ │ ├─ blocks/
│ │ │ ├─ <block>/
│ │ │ │ ├─ <challenge>.md
│ │ ├─ certifications/
│ │ │ ├─ <certification>.yml
├─ i18n-curriculum/ (git submodule)
│ ├─ curriculum/
│ │ ├─ challenges/
│ │ │ ├─ <language>/
│ │ │ │ ├─ blocks/
│ │ │ │ │ ├─ <block>/
│ │ │ │ │ │ ├─ <challenge>.md
├─ structure/
│ ├─ curriculum.json
│ ├─ superblocks/
│ │ ├─ <superblock>.json
│ ├─ blocks/
│ │ ├─ <block>.json
```

## The Structure Directory

The `structure` directory contains JSON files that define the curriculum organization and are used to determine which superBlock a block belongs to, and the order of the challenges within that block.

### curriculum.json

The main `curriculum.json` file contains two arrays:

- `superblocks`: An ordered list of all superblocks in the curriculum
- `certifications`: A list of all available certifications

### superblocks/&lt;superblock&gt;.json

Each superblock has its own JSON file that defines which blocks belong to it. Simple superblocks only contain a `blocks` array:

```json
{
  "blocks": ["basic-html-and-html5", "basic-css", "applied-visual-design"]
}
```

More complex superblocks can organize blocks into chapters and modules for better structure:

```json
{
  "chapters": [
    {
      "dashedName": "html",
      "modules": [
        {
          "dashedName": "basic-html",
          "blocks": [
            "workshop-curriculum-outline",
            "lecture-welcome-to-freecodecamp",
            "lab-debug-camperbots-profile-page",
            "lecture-understanding-html-attributes"
          ]
        },
        {
          "dashedName": "semantic-html",
          "blocks": [
            "lecture-importance-of-semantic-html",
            "lecture-understanding-nuanced-semantic-elements",
            "workshop-blog-page"
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "dashedName": "css",
      "modules": [
        {
          "dashedName": "basic-css",
          "blocks": [
            "lecture-what-is-css",
            "workshop-cafe-menu",
            "lab-business-card"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### blocks/&lt;block&gt;.json

Each block has its own JSON file that contains metadata and the order of challenges:

```json
{
  "name": "Basic HTML and HTML5",
  "isUpcomingChange": false,
  "dashedName": "basic-html-and-html5",
  "helpCategory": "HTML-CSS",
  "challengeOrder": [
    {
      "id": "bd7123c8c441eddfaeb5bdef",
      "title": "Say Hello to HTML Elements"
    }
  ]
}
```

## The Certifications Directory

The `challenges/english/certifications/` directory contains YAML files that define the certification requirements and project information for each certification.

Each certification YAML file includes the following key properties:

- **`id`**: Unique identifier for the certification
- **`title`**: Display name of the certification
- **`certification`**: Internal name used to reference the certification
- **`tests`**: Array of required projects with their IDs and titles

## Internationalization Structure

The curriculum content is internationalized using a git submodule located at `curriculum/i18n-curriculum/`. This submodule contains translated versions of curriculum content:

- **English content**: Located directly in `curriculum/challenges/english/`
- **Translated content**: Located in the submodule at `curriculum/i18n-curriculum/curriculum/challenges/<language>/`

The structure within each language directory mirrors the English structure exactly, with the same block folders and challenge files. However, only the Markdown challenge files (`.md`) are translated and stored in the i18n-curriculum submodule. Configuration files such as YAML certification files and JSON structure files remain in English only.

:::important
The i18n-curriculum submodule is updated automatically. Manual changes to translated content should not be made directly in the submodule.
:::

## Renaming Files

There may be times when you need to rename a certificate, superblock, block, or challenge. This section will outline the steps needed to avoid build errors when doing so.

:::danger
Renaming files within the curriculum structure will often change the path (or URL) of the content on the main webpage. Doing so should be done with care, as redirects have to be set up for each change that is made.
:::

### Setting Up Redirects

When renaming curriculum items that change URLs, you **must** set up redirects to ensure existing links continue to work. This requires updating two `serve.json` files with identical redirect configurations:

1. **Client Configuration**: `/client-config/serve.json`
2. **Main Application**: `/client/serve/serve.json`

Both files contain a `"redirects"` array where you need to add redirect objects. The redirect format follows this pattern:

```json
{
  "source": "/learn/old-name/:param?",
  "destination": "/learn/new-name/:param?"
}
```

**URL Parameters:**

- `:superblock?` - Captures superblock name (optional)
- `:block?` - Captures block name (optional)
- `:challenge?` - Captures challenge name (optional)

**Examples:**

For superblock renaming (e.g., `apis-and-microservices` → `back-end-development-and-apis`):

```json
{
  "source": "/learn/apis-and-microservices/:block?/:challenge?",
  "destination": "/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/:block?/:challenge?"
}
```

For block renaming within a superblock:

```json
{
  "source": "/learn/responsive-web-design/old-block-name/:challenge?",
  "destination": "/learn/responsive-web-design/new-block-name/:challenge?"
}
```

For individual challenge renaming:

```json
{
  "source": "/learn/superblock/block/old-challenge-name",
  "destination": "/learn/superblock/block/new-challenge-name"
}
```

:::important
**Both `serve.json` files must be updated with identical redirects.**
**The redirect setup must be done in a separate PR that gets merged AT THE SAME TIME as the PR that actually renames the curriculum items.** This ensures the redirects go live simultaneously with the URL changes, preventing any broken links.
:::

### Renaming a Certification

When renaming a certification, you will likely want to rename the associated superblock along with it. Do the following to rename only the certificate:

<Steps>

1. Rename the `curriculum/challenges/english/certifications/<certification>.yml` file to the new name.
2. In the YAML file, change the `title` to the new name.
3. Update the `certifications` array in `curriculum/structure/curriculum.json` to use the new certification name.
4. Update `client/src/redux/index.ts` to use the correct `title`.
5. Optionally, update the `certSlug` for the superblock in the same file. (Note: Renaming a `certSlug` will change the URL for certifications and should only be done with careful consideration.)
6. **If you renamed the `certSlug`**, add redirects to both `serve.json` files (`/client-config/serve.json` and `/client/serve/serve.json`) to redirect from old certification URLs to new ones:
   ```json
   {
     "source": "/certification/old-cert-slug",
     "destination": "/certification/new-cert-slug"
   }
   ```
7. Update the `title` in `client/src/resources/cert-and-project-map.ts` to the new value. (Note: Changing the `title` here **will break** the superBlock page for the associated certification. It relies on the superBlock title to match the certification title. You will likely want to rename the superBlock at the same time.)
8. If you renamed the `certSlug` in step 5, change it here for the cert and all the nested `projects` values.
9. In `shared/config/certification-settings.js`, update the value of `certTypeTitleMap` to the new name.
10. In `shared/config/certification-settings.js`, update the value of `certTypeTitleMap` to the new name.
11. If you renamed the `certSlug` in step 5, update the key of `certSlugTypeMap` in the same file.
12. Update the certificate name in the `legacyCerts` array of the `client/src/client-only-routes/show-project-links.tsx` if needed.
13. Update the main `README.md` file to the new name.

</Steps>

:::note
Translated content in the i18n-curriculum submodule will be updated automatically and does not require manual intervention.
:::

### Renaming a Superblock

:::note
When you rename a superBlock, the new folder name is used as the path and should be considered the "correct" name. All other values should be updated to reflect that change.
:::

Also, you will likely want to rename the certificate and the `<superBlock>-projects` block when you rename a superBlock since they all share a name. To rename only a superBlock you need to:

<Steps>

1. Rename the superblock file in `curriculum/structure/superblocks/` from `<old-name>.json` to `<new-name>.json`.
2. Update the `superblocks` array in `curriculum/structure/curriculum.json` to use the new superblock name.
3. For each block within that superBlock, update the `superBlock` value in their respective JSON files in `curriculum/structure/blocks/` to the new dashedName.
4. **Add redirects** to both `serve.json` files (`/client-config/serve.json` and `/client/serve/serve.json`) to redirect from old superblock URLs to new ones:
   ```json
   {
     "source": "/learn/old-superblock-name/:block?/:challenge?",
     "destination": "/learn/new-superblock-name/:block?/:challenge?"
   }
   ```
5. Rename the superblock folder in `client/src/pages/learn`.
6. Update the `index.md` file in the renamed superblock folder, changing the `title` and `superBlock` values to the new name.
7. For each block folder within the above, update the `index.md` to use the correct `superBlock` value.
8. For each block folder within the above, update the `index.md` to use the correct `superBlock` value.
9. In the `client/src/resources/cert-and-project-map.ts` file, update the path for the cert at the top of the file, and the `title` value for that superBlock. (Note: Changing the `title` here **will break** the ability to view the actual certification for this superBlock. It relies on the superBlock title to match the certification title. You will likely want to rename the certification at the same time.)
10. Update the `superBlockCertTypeMap` key in `shared/config/certification-settings.js` to the new superBlock name.
11. Update the path value in `client/src/assets/icons/index.tsx`.
12. For each language in `client/i18n/locales`, update the `intro.json` file to use the new superBlock `dashedName`. In the English file, also update the `title`.
13. Check the `shared/config/i18n/all-langs.js` file to see if the superBlock is enabled in i18n builds. Update all the values where it is used.
14. Update the `superBlockNames` map in `curriculum/build-curriculum.js`. This map links superblock filenames (keys) to certification names (values) - update the key if the superblock filename changed, and update the value if the certification name changed.
15. Update the main `README.md` file to the new name.

</Steps>

### Renaming a Block

When renaming a curriculum block, you need to:

<Steps>

1. Change the name of the block folder in the `curriculum/challenges/english/blocks/<block>` directory.
2. Rename the block's JSON file in `curriculum/structure/blocks/` from `<old-name>.json` to `<new-name>.json`.
3. Update the `name` and `dashedName` properties in the renamed block JSON file.
4. Update the superblock's JSON file in `curriculum/structure/superblocks/` to reference the new block name in its `blocks` array.
5. **Add redirects** to both `serve.json` files (`/client-config/serve.json` and `/client/serve/serve.json`) to redirect from old block URLs to new ones:
   ```json
   {
     "source": "/learn/superblock-name/old-block-name/:challenge?",
     "destination": "/learn/superblock-name/new-block-name/:challenge?"
   }
   ```
6. Update the block folder in `client/src/pages/learn/<superBlock>`.
7. In the `index.md` file of the above folder, update the `block` value in the frontmatter.
8. In the `client/i18n/locales/<language>/intro.json` files, update the block name to the new name for all the languages. In the English `intro.json` file, update the `title` as well.
9. In the `client/i18n/locales/<language>/intro.json` files, update the block name to the new name for all the languages. In the English `intro.json` file, update the `title` as well.
10. Update the main `README.md` file to the new name.

</Steps>

### Renaming a Challenge

When renaming a single challenge file, you need to:

<Steps>

1. Change the name of the challenge file in the `curriculum/challenges/english/blocks/<block>/` directory.
2. Change the name of the `title` and `dashedName` within that file.
3. Update the challenge title in the relevant block JSON file in `curriculum/structure/blocks/<block>.json`. The challenge names in the `challengeOrder` array are used in the build and provide the order of challenges.
4. **Add redirects** to both `serve.json` files (`/client-config/serve.json` and `/client/serve/serve.json`) to redirect from old challenge URLs to new ones:
   ```json
   {
     "source": "/learn/superblock-name/block-name/old-challenge-name",
     "destination": "/learn/superblock-name/block-name/new-challenge-name"
   }
   ```
5. If the challenge is a certificate project, update the YAML file in `curriculum/challenges/english/certifications/<certification>.yml` to the new name.
6. If the challenge is a certificate project, update the `title` and `link` in `client/src/resources/cert-and-project-map.ts`
7. If the challenge is a certificate project, update the main `README.md` file to the new name.
8. If the challenge is a certificate project, update the main `README.md` file to the new name.

</Steps>

:::note
Translated content in the i18n-curriculum submodule will be updated automatically and does not require manual intervention.

## The `dashedName` Property

The `dashedName` property is used to generate the URL path for the superblock, block, or challenge. These should generally match what the `/utils/slugs.js` helper would output for the file name.
