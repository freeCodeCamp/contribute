title: English for Developers Curriculum Structure
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The **English for Developers** curriculum is designed to help non-native English speakers improve their language skills, focusing on communication in software development. This curriculum aligns with the **Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR)** and provides structured lessons for learners at different proficiency levels.

## Curriculum Levels

The curriculum is structured into multiple levels, each targeting specific language skills essential for developers:

- **CEFR Level A2** – A pre-intermediate level focusing on foundational English skills. It introduces essential vocabulary, phrases, and real-world scenarios that developers encounter in their daily work.
- **CEFR Level B1** – An intermediate level that builds on the basics. It emphasizes professional communication, reading technical documentation, and participating in workplace discussions.

Future levels, including **B2 and C1**, will further enhance learners’ proficiency in advanced technical and professional communication.

## How the Curriculum is Structured

The beta version of the **English for Developers** curriculum is structured around contextual modules, each built on a series of dialogues. Campers begin by listening or reading the full dialogue they will study. Then, step by step, tasks guide them through each line, introducing relevant vocabulary, grammatical structures, and practical usage in a developer’s context.

This documentation outlines the framework used to create these tasks, ensuring that contributors can review the curriculum while maintaining consistency with standard guidelines.
