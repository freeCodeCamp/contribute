title: The Official freeCodeCamp Moderator Onboarding Guide

This guide will help new moderators get up and running with the processes and procedures followed by experienced moderators on the freeCodeCamp community forum and other official communities we foster.

## The Forum

### First Steps

The first thing you may notice after being given moderator status on the forum is that your interface will look somewhat different, with new admin tools to explore and access to the Mod-Team subforum.

Some of the new tools will appear inside a new menu item that looks like a wrench. Some will appear as new tabs or buttons, or even new enabled options within the forum menus.

To get familiar with the new tools and powers, you can combine one or more of the following methods during your first week with this elevated role:

The first two are the most important.

### Become Familiar with the Discourse Admin Tools

The freeCodeCamp forum is a Discourse forum and follows many of the same guidelines of other forums built on Discourse. To begin to get familiar with Discourse and the moderation role, start by reading Discourse's [new user guide](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-new-user-guide/96331) and Discourse's [new moderator guide](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-moderation-guide/63116).

### Shadow a Mod

All moderator actions can be followed by reviewing the [action logs](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/admin/logs/staff_action_logs). The actions taken by automated tools like `Akismet` or `system` can mostly be ignored until they result in a post that needs to be reviewed. Posts to be reviewed will show up in the [Review](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/review) area of the forum.

For the first week or so you will want to pay attention to what is getting flagged and what is being reviewed, and compare that to the actions being taken upon the flagged posts. You may see the system account flag a post because the user created it too quickly. In many cases, the moderators will unflag the post by clicking on the "Approve Post" button or mark it as "Not Spam" (depending on the flag type).

Commonly, spam flags can also be raised by members or moderators. Common duplicitous behavior would involve opening an account, making a post that seems harmless, then editing that post later on to add a link to an external site to advertise it. In this case, the member account is usually fairly new and has only made this one post thus far, which indicates that the account was opened solely for spamming the community. The decision should be made to delete the account after the first offense in this case. The same applies to accounts whose first post is deemed to be spam.

You may notice moderators performing a procedure called 'split topic'. This may be a case where a moderator has split a post that was made erroneously on an existing topic into a new topic, or a moderator merged duplicate topics that a single user has created for the same question. Watching this procedure will highlight different actions and their causes.

Another useful feature that becomes enabled for all moderators is the ability to post a "Canned Reply" which is a pre-written response that was worked out with the mod team to quickly respond to some well-known and repetitive scenarios. These include:

- Welcoming a new forum member who has posted code without a question -> "Welcome - remind question"
- Reminding members not to post code solutions but to provide hints and tips instead -> "Solutions Instead of Help"
- Responding to a situation where someone's code works for you but not for them -> "Browser Issues"
- Encouraging members to open GitHub issues when a possible bug is found -> "Bug Report"

There are more, which you can read through to become familiar with their respective uses. You can also find discussions around the templates in the mod-team subforum, and you are welcome to ask questions if you aren't sure how a template should be used.

### Read Mod-Team Subforum Posts

The Mod-Team subforum contains several posts from past and current moderators discussing the different requirements and/or challenges of moderating the forum.

Reading back through these posts can help uncover some of the underlying goals and processes that concern forum moderators. Some of the threads may also shed some light on the handling of spam and inappropriate content on the forum.

## Where to Ask for Help

To get help dealing with a situation that you are either uncomfortable with or unsure of how to handle, discuss with your fellow moderators on either the [Mod-Team Subforum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/mod-team/4) or the [#mod-chat](https://discord.com/channels/692816967895220344/693157007418720277) on Discord.
