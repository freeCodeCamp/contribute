Our workshops use a step-based approach to teach concepts to campers. A workshop will consist of multiple files, which we refer to as **"steps"**. These files are named by the challenge ID, to avoid issues with the translation flow. Unfortunately, this makes it difficult to find the file associated with a specific step.

We've built a [challenge editor tool](#using-the-challenge-editor) that helps remedy this. This tool allows you to navigate the available workshops, and the steps for each workshop (in order). There's also an embedded code editor you can use to work on the files directly.

## Styling pointers

Workshops should alternate steps in which new concepts are introduced small piece by piece, and steps where there is freedom of implementation.

Instructions should always be written using second person, and the hints usually use a format like "You should have...", or "This thing should be/have/do/return...".

If it's possible to test the effects of the code instead of what's being written exactly, that is preferred.

For example, you could ask in a step to create a variable inside a function, and that would need to be tested with regex. Ideally you would ask to instead log a specific value with `console.log`, or an other side effect that can be tested.

We can test the existence and the value of a variable in the global scope, so that's less of an issue.

For the tests, the [chai asserts](https://www.chaijs.com/api/assert/) are available for use. It is preferred to use specific methods instead of the generic `assert()`.

For example, you can test if the variable `a` has a value of `2` with `assert(a === 2)`, but it is preferred the useage of `assert.strictEqual(a, 2)` (specifically `strictEqual` as the `equal` method is equivalent to using `==` and we don't want to have a success if the variable has a value of the string `"2"`).

Consult the [curriculum helpers](/curriculum-help/) to know what's available to help you test the code written by the camper.

## Create the workshop

Workshops will have a dashedName of the kind `workshop-cat-photo-app`, that is the word `workshop` followed by the name of the app that is being built.

Workshop titles start with "Build a" or "Design a", followed by the name of the app.

Some workshops, which are debugging workshop, will be called `Debugging a ...` and have prefix `workshop-debugging` in the `dashedName`.

You can create the workshop with `pnpm run create-new-project`.

The metadata for workshops require a `blockType` property with a value of `workshop`, and a `blockLayout` with a value of `challenge-grid`.

## Using the Challenge Editor

These instructions will tell you how to use our challenge editor tool to work on the workshops.

### Starting the Editor

To start the editor, make sure you are in the root freeCodeCamp directory. Then, run `pnpm run challenge-editor` to start both the client and the API that powers the editor.

The client will run on port `3300`, so you can access it at `http://localhost:3300`. The API runs on port `3200`, to avoid conflicts with the learn client and server. This will allow you to run the freeCodeCamp application at the same time as the editor, so you can test your changes locally.

### Navigating the Editor

The default view will list the available `superblocks` - these are the certifications. Click on the certification link you want to work on.

This will take you to the list of blocks. These are the workshops. Click on the workshop link you want to work on.

This will take you to a list of steps for the project. If you are working on an existing step, you can click on the step link to open the editor. If you are adding or removing steps, click the `Use the step tools` link to switch to the step tools for that challenge.

### Editing Steps

When you click on a step, you'll be taken to the editor. This is a basic text editor that offers syntax highlighting.

After you have made your changes, click the `Save Changes` button to save your changes. You will get a browser alert letting you know that your changes are ready to commit.

:::note
You'll need to use `git` manually to stage and commit your files - this tool will not do that for you.
:::

### Step Tools

When you click the `Use the step tools` link, you'll be taken to the step tools page. This allows you to add or remove steps from the project.

#### Create Next Step

Clicking this button will add a new step at the end of the project. This step will use the previous step's code as the seed.

#### Create Empty Steps

Enter the number of steps you want to add in the input. Then, clicking the button will create many empty steps at the end of the project.

#### Insert Step

Enter the step number that you want to add. Then, click the `Insert Step` button to add the step. The following steps will be re-ordered.

#### Delete Step

Enter the step number you want to delete. Then click the `Delete Step` button to remove that step. This will automatically update the step numbers for the remaining steps.

#### Update Step Titles

You should not have to use this tool unless you've manually deleted or added steps. This tool will reorder the step numbers.

## Using the Scripts Manually

If you want to work on the steps manually, in your local IDE, you can run the step management scripts directly.

The `tools/challenge-helper-scripts` folder contains tools to help facilitate the creation and maintenance of the freeCodeCamp project-based curriculum.

### Create a New Project

Run `pnpm run create-new-project`. This opens up a command line UI that guides you through the process. Once that has finished, there should be a new challenge in the English curriculum that you can use for the first step of the project. For example, if you created a project called `test-project` in the Responsive Web Design certification, it would be in `curriculum/challenges/english/blocks/test-project`.

If you want to create new steps, the following tools simplify that process.

### create-next-step

A one-off script that will automatically add the next step based on the last step in the project. The challenge seed code will use the previous step's challenge seed code.

#### How to Run the Script

1. Change to the directory of the project.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run create-next-step
```

### create-empty-steps

A one-off script that automatically adds a specified number of steps. The challenge seed code for all steps created will be empty.

:::note
This script also runs [update-step-titles](#update-step-titles).
:::

#### How to Run the Script

1. Change to the directory of the project.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run create-empty-steps X # where X is the number of steps to create.
```

### insert-step

A one-off script that automatically adds a new step at a specified position, incrementing all subsequent steps (both their titles and in the block's JSON structure file). The challenge seed code will use the previous step's challenge seed code with the editable region markers (ERMs) removed.

:::note
This script also runs [update-step-titles](#update-step-titles).
:::

#### How to Run the Script

1. Change to the directory of the project.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run insert-step X # where X is the position to insert the new step.
```

### delete-step

A one-off script that deletes an existing step, decrementing all subsequent steps (both their titles and in the block's JSON structure file)

:::note
This script also runs [update-step-titles](#update-step-titles).
:::

#### How to Run the Script

1. Change to the directory of the project.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run delete-step X # where X is the step number to be deleted.
```

### update-step-titles

A one-off script that automatically updates the frontmatter in a project's markdown files so that they are consistent with the block's JSON structure file. It ensures that each step's title (and dashedName) matches the block structure's `challengeOrder`.

#### How to Run the Script

1. Change to the directory of the project.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run update-step-titles
```

### repair-meta

One-off script to parse the step names from the project and update the block's JSON structure file order to reflect those steps. Useful if you've accidentally lost the changes to the block structure file when adding/removing steps.

#### How to Run the Script

1. Change to the directory of the project.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run repair-meta
```

### rename-challenges

The script is to be used if the step-based project has files that have challenges ids and filenames that do not match.

#### How to Run the Script

1. Be in the root directory
2. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run rename-challenges
```
