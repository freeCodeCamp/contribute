Our workshops use a step-based approach to teach concepts to campers. A workshop will consist of multiple files, which we refer to as **"steps"**. These files are named by the challenge ID, to avoid issues with the translation flow. Unfortunately, this makes it difficult to find the file associated with a specific step.

We've built a [challenge editor tool](#using-the-challenge-editor) that helps remedy this. This tool allows you to navigate the available workshops, and the steps for each workshop (in order). There's also an embedded code editor you can use to work on the files directly.

## Styling pointers

Workshops should introduce new concepts gradually. Break complex ideas into small, easy-to-understand steps.

Instructions should always be written using second person, and the hints usually use a format like "You should have...", or "This thing should be/have/do/return...".

Whenever possible, test the effects of the code rather than verifying exactly what was written.

For example, you might ask learners to create a variable inside a function, which would require testing with regular expressions. Instead, it is preferable to ask them to log a specific value using `console.log`, or produce another side effect that can be tested more reliably.

We can test the existence and value of a variable in the global scope, so that is less of an issue.

For writing tests, the [Chai assertions](https://www.chaijs.com/api/assert/) are available for use. It is preferred to use specific assertion methods rather than the generic `assert()` function.

For example, you could test whether the variable `a` has a value of `2` using `assert(a === 2)`. However, it is recommended to use `assert.strictEqual(a, 2)` instead. The `strictEqual` method is preferred because `equal` performs a loose comparison (equivalent to using `==`), which could incorrectly pass if the variable has the string value `"2"` instead of the number `2`.

Consult the [curriculum helpers](/curriculum-help/) to see what utilities are available to help you test the code written by the camper.

## Create the workshop

Workshops use a `dashedName` format such as `workshop-cat-photo-app`. This consists of the word `workshop` followed by the name of the app being built.

Workshop titles should start with "Build a" or "Design a", followed by the name of the app.

Some workshops are debugging workshops. These should start with `Debugging a ...` and use the prefix `workshop-debugging` in the `dashedName`.

You can create a workshop by running `pnpm run create-new-project`.

The workshop metadata requires a `blockType` property with a value of `workshop`, and a `blockLayout` property with a value of `challenge-grid`.

## Using the Challenge Editor

These instructions explain how to use the challenge editor tool to work on workshops.

### Setting Up the Challenge Editor

The first time you use the editor, and after running `clean` commands (such as `clean-and-develop`), ensure you are in the root `freeCodeCamp` directory and run:

`pnpm challenge-editor-setup`

### Starting the Editor

Once the editor is set up, run `pnpm run challenge-editor` (again from the root directory) to start both the client and the API that powers the editor.

The client runs on port `3300`, which you can access at `http://localhost:3300`. The API runs on port `3200` to avoid conflicts with the learn client and server. This setup allows you to run the freeCodeCamp application at the same time as the editor, so you can test your changes locally.

### Navigating the Editor

The default view displays the available `superblocks`, which represent the certifications. Click on the certification you want to work on.

This will take you to a list of blocks, which correspond to workshops. Select the workshop you want to edit.

You will then see a list of steps for that project. If you are editing an existing step, click the corresponding step to open it in the editor. If you are adding or removing steps, use the appropriate options provided in the interface.

### Editing Steps

When you click on a step, you will be taken to the editor. This is a basic text editor with syntax highlighting.

After making your changes, click the `Save Changes` button. You will see a browser alert confirming that your changes are ready to be committed.

:::note
You will need to use `git` manually to stage and commit your files. The challenge editor does not perform these actions automatically.
:::

### Step Tools

When you click the `Use the step tools` link, you'll be taken to the step tools page. This allows you to add or remove steps from the project.

#### Create Next Step

Clicking this button will add a new step at the end of the project. This step will use the previous step's code as the seed.

#### Create Empty Steps

Enter the number of steps you want to add in the input. Then, clicking the button will create many empty steps at the end of the project.

#### Insert Step

Enter the step number that you want to add. Then, click the `Insert Step` button to add the step. The following steps will be re-ordered.

#### Delete Step

Enter the step number you want to delete. Then click the `Delete Step` button to remove that step. This will automatically update the step numbers for the remaining steps.

#### Update Step Titles

You should not have to use this tool unless you've manually deleted or added steps. This tool will reorder the step numbers.

## Using the Scripts Manually

If you want to work on the steps manually, in your local IDE, you can run the following commands directly.

The `tools/challenge-helper-scripts` folder contains tools to help facilitate the creation and maintenance of the freeCodeCamp project-based curriculum.

### Create a New Project

Run `pnpm run create-new-project`. This opens up a command line UI that guides you through the process. Once that has finished, there should be a new challenge in the English curriculum that you can use for the first step of the project. For example, if you created a project called `test-project` in the Responsive Web Design certification, it would be in `curriculum/challenges/english/blocks/test-project`.

If you want to create new steps, the following tools simplify that process.

### create-next-step

A one-off script that will automatically add the next step based on the last step in the project. The challenge seed code will use the previous step's challenge seed code.

#### How to Run the Script

1. Change the directory to the currrent project by copying the path and running in terminal.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run create-next-step
```

### create-empty-steps

A one-off script that automatically adds a specified number of steps. The challenge seed code for all steps created will be empty.

:::note
This script also runs [update-step-titles](#update-step-titles).
:::

#### How to Run the Script

1. Change to the directory of the project by copying the path and running in terminal.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run create-empty-steps X # where X is the number of steps to create.
```

### insert-step

A one-off script that automatically adds a new step at a specified position, incrementing all subsequent steps (both their titles and in the block's JSON structure file). The challenge seed code will use the previous step's challenge seed code with the editable region markers (ERMs) removed.

:::note
This script also runs [update-step-titles](#update-step-titles).
:::

#### How to Run the Script

1. Change to the directory of the project by copying the path and running in terminal.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run insert-step X # where X is the position to insert the new step.
```

### delete-step

A one-off script that deletes an existing step, decrementing all subsequent steps (both their titles and in the block's JSON structure file)

:::note
This script also runs [update-step-titles](#update-step-titles).
:::

#### How to Run the Script

1. Change to the directory of the project by copying the path and running in terminal.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run delete-step X # where X is the step number to be deleted.
```

### update-step-titles

A one-off script that automatically updates the frontmatter in a project's markdown files so that they are consistent with the block's JSON structure file. It ensures that each step's title (and dashedName) matches the block structure's `challengeOrder`.

#### How to Run the Script

1. Change to the directory of the project by copying the path and running in terminal.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run update-step-titles
```

### repair-meta

One-off script to parse the step names from the project and update the block's JSON structure file order to reflect those steps. Useful if you've accidentally lost the changes to the block structure file when adding/removing steps.

#### How to Run the Script

1. Change to the directory of the project by copying the path and running in terminal.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run repair-meta
```

### rename-challenges

The script is to be used if the step-based project has files that have challenges ids and filenames that do not match.

#### How to Run the Script

1. Be in the root directory
2. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run rename-challenges
```
