title: Courses VSCode Extension
---

This details the maintenance guidelines for the [freeCodeCamp/courses-vscode-extension](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/courses-vscode-extension) repository which contains the source code for the [freeCodeCamp - Courses](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=freeCodeCamp.freecodecamp-courses) extension.

## Publishing the Extension

A GitHub Action automagically publishes the extension to the Visual Studio Marketplace, on the release of a new GitHub Release.

1. Package a new version of the extension:

```bash
npm run pack -- <tag_type>
```

Where `<tag_type>` is one of: `major`, `minor`, `patch`.

2. Push the new version to `main`:

```bash
git commit -am "<tag_type>(<version>): <description>"
git push
```

Optionally, you can push directly to `upstream/main`, but opening a new PR is recommended for a sanity check.

3. Create a new GitHub Release using the GitHub UI:

- Correctly increment the version number, when creating a new tag.
- Upload the `.vsix` file with the release.
- Publish the release, and confirm the action succeeded.

:::note
Creating a release requires write access to the `freeCodeCamp/courses-vscode-extension` repository.
