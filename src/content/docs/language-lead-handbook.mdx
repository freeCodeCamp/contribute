## How to Invite New Contributors to Ghost

Ghost allows you to set contributors with different levels of authorization.

Most of your invites will be for the "Contributor" level. This level allows the user to create drafts. Select this role when inviting a new translator.

The "Author" level allows the user to create Drafts and publish them.

The "Editor" level allows the user to access all Drafts and publish them. Select this role when inviting a new proofreader.

The "Administrator" level is reserved for freeCodeCamp staff and Language Leads.

### How are the Articles Built

We use a [JAMStack](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+jamstack)-based approach to build and deploy the articles. This strategy makes for a speedy static site cached and served from a CDN.

[Ghost](https://ghost.org) acts as our content management platform, and [11ty](https://11ty.dev) builds the articles into static assets – plain HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Only these static assets are deployed to our servers.

This process is automated and runs periodically. If you publish something now, it will be available on the news site in a few hours.

You can find the up-to-date build schedules and status here: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/news#build

## How to Mention the Original Author of a Translated Article

The original author and the original article are linked automatically adding this code to the Code Injection -> head section in the Draft Settings on Ghost.

```html
<script>
  const fccOriginalPost = 'link';
</script>
```

With `link` being the link of the original article.

## How to set up the auto-translation workflow for a new language

- Add the prompt that you want to give to the OpenAI API
- Add the GitHub issue template and the CODEOWNERS configuration

### Add prompt

1. Clone the repository [freeCodeCamp/articles-auto-translate-action](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/articles-auto-translate-action)
2. Run `pnpm install`
3. Add the prompt in [src/tasks/task_auto_translate_step_02_trans_articles.ts](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/articles-auto-translate-action/blob/main/src/tasks/task_auto_translate_step_02_trans_articles.ts) file as shown in the image below
4. Run `pnpm run build`. This will update `dist/index.js`
5. Open a pull request including the modified files (`src/tasks/task_auto_translate_step_02_trans_articels.ts` and `dist/index.js`)

The prompt should say something similar to below. You can customize the prompt to get the best result for your language.

```
I have an md file, please translate it into [Language]. The translation must strictly maintain the format and layout of the original markdown file. Please provide the translation directly without asking questions.
```

![Where to add the prompt](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/images/github/auto-translate-prompt.png)

### Add issue template and update CODEOWNERS

1. Clone the repository [freeCodeCamp/news-translation-tasks](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/news-translation-tasks)
2. The issue template files are in [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/news-translation-tasks/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) directory
3. Add the file for your language. Make sure to use the language code that matches with the key you added in the prompt object above, as shown in the image below
4. Update the file [.github/CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/news-translation-tasks/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS) to add the new language
5. Open a pull request

The issue template should look like this:

```
---
name: Translation Task (Machine Translation)
about: "Add new articles to be translated and automatically crawled using automatic GitHub Actions."
title: "[<2-letter language code>] (Put the translated title here)"
sidebar:
  label: "Language Lead Handbook"
labels: ["<language>"]
assignees: ''
---

[Original Title](https://example.com/path/to/your/article/)
```

![Use the same language code](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/images/github/auto-translate-langcode.png)

The CODEOWNERS file should look like this:

```
# -------------------------------------------------
# Files that need attention from each language lead
# -------------------------------------------------

/articles/es/*.md @RafaelDavisH
/articles/ja/*.md @sidemt
...

```

Add a line in the following format: `/articles/<2-letter language code>/*.md @<username of the language lead>`

This way, the language lead can get notified when someone opens a PR for the translation files for that language.

## How to start the auto-translation workflow

After the two pull requests are merged, you can start using the auto-translation workflow.

In this workflow, each GitHub issue corresponds to an article to be translated.

1. Go to [freeCodeCamp/news-translation-tasks](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/news-translation-tasks) repository

2. Click "New issue"

3. Click "Get started" button for your language to open the issue template

The minimum requirements to use the workflow are as follows:

- 2-letter language code in the square brackets at the beginning of the issue title
- URL of the English article in the description as a link
- `auto` label

![Issue template](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/images/github/auto-translate-issue.png)

Additional information:

- When you just paste the URL, GitHub automatically converts it into a link so it works too. You don't necessarily have to make it a markdown link in [title](URL) format.
- You need to add `auto` label manually, since this step works as a permission check. Only users with "Triage" role or higher can add labels. We usually invite new contributors as "Read" role, so they can't trigger auto-translation workflow.
- If you forget to add the `auto` label when creating an issue, you can add it later. You can also restart the workflow by removing and adding the `auto` label.

4. When the `auto` label is added to an issue, the auto-translation workflow is triggered. You can check the status of the workflow run in the "Actions" tab.

![GitHub Actions status](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/images/github/auto-translate-actions.png)

5. When the workflow run is complete, it adds an issue comment like below. It is ready for contributors to start post-editing.

![Comment added by GitHub Actions](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/images/github/auto-translate-comment.png)

## How to Update Trending Articles

:::tip
Changing the articles in the footer at least once a month means giving a boost to the linked articles on Google results.
:::

To update the trending articles in the footer, you need to update the [yaml file in the CDN repository](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/cdn/tree/main/build/universal/trending) for your language. Both the curriculum and the publication reference this file.

For example, here is the file content for the first 6 articles:

```yaml
article0title: 'Unire CSV con Python'
article0link: 'https://www.freecodecamp.org/italian/news/come-combinare-file-multipli-in-formato-csv-con-8-righe-di-codice/'
article1title: 'Il comando Git push'
article1link: 'https://www.freecodecamp.org/italian/news/il-comando-git-push-spiegato/'
article2title: 'Centrare immagini in CSS'
article2link: 'https://www.freecodecamp.org/italian/news/come-centrare-un-immagine-usando/'
article3title: 'I codici Alt'
article3link: 'https://www.freecodecamp.org/italian/news/codici-alt/'
article4title: 'Tenere a bada il footer'
article4link: 'https://www.freecodecamp.org/italian/news/come-mantenere-il-footer-al-suo-posto/'
article5title: 'Cosa è API?'
article5link: 'https://www.freecodecamp.org/italian/news/cose-un-api-in-italiano-per-favore/'
```

Each number represents one of the 30 articles in the footer. Make sure to match the title and the link correctly.

For each article, you will need to create a shorter title to use in the footer. Each title must stay on a single line and not go to a new line.

You will want to [build the translated client locally](/how-to-enable-new-languages/) to see if the titles have the right length. You can preview the changes by editing the `trending.json` file in your local environment:

<Steps>

1. Update your `.env` file to use your language for `CLIENT_LOCALE` and `CURRICULUM_LOCALE`.
2. Run `pnpm run create:shared`. This will automatically generate the `trending.json` file for your language under the `/client/i18n/locales/` directory.
3. Start the server by running `pnpm run develop:server` in one terminal window.
4. Edit the `trending.json` to contain the titles you want to preview. You may want to convert your `.yaml` file into JSON format with an automatic tool.
5. In another terminal window, run `pnpm run clean:client`, and then `pnpm run develop:client`

</Steps>

## How to Translate Articles in the Footer Links

There are some links listed at the bottom of the footer (About, Alumni Network, Open Source, etc.) and some of them can be translated into your language in the same way as other articles.

Articles that can be translated:

- About
- Support
- Academic Honesty
- Code of Conduct

The following articles should **not** be translated:

- Shop
- Sponsors
- Privacy Policy
- Terms of Service
- Copyright Policy

The following links are pointing to external sites and cannot be translated:

- Alumni Network
- Open Source

### Change the Footer Links in the News

Once you have translated and published the articles listed as "can be translated" above, you can update the links in the footer for `/news` by editing the file at `news/config/i18n/locales/<your language>/links.json` in the [freeCodeCamp/news](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/news) repository.

:::note
Pull requests to this repository are currently limited to staff only. If you want to update this file, ask someone on the staff team for help.
:::

Update the following part in the file:

```json
{
  ...
  "footer": {
    "about": "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/about/",
    "support": "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/support/",
    "honesty": "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/academic-honesty-policy/",
    "coc": "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/code-of-conduct/"
  }
}
```

### Change the Footer Links in the Curriculum

When you have translated and published the articles listed as "can be translated" above, as well as when the curriculum in your language is ready for launch, you can update the links in the footer for `/learn` by editing the file at `client/i18n/locales/<your language>/links.json` in the [freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp) repository.

:::caution
Only "About", "Support", "Academic Honesty", and "Code of Conduct" can be translated. Leave other URLs unchanged.
:::

Update the following part in the file:

```json
{
  ...
  "footer": {
    "about-url": "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/about/",
    "shop-url": "https://www.freecodecamp.org/shop/",
    "support-url": "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/support/",
    "sponsors-url": "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/sponsors/",
    "honesty-url": "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/academic-honesty-policy/",
    "coc-url": "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/code-of-conduct/",
    "privacy-url": "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/privacy-policy/",
    "tos-url": "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/terms-of-service/",
    "copyright-url": "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/copyright-policy/"
  },
  ...
}
```

## How to Translate the Info Boxes Headers in the Documentation

You can find these boxes all around the documentation:

:::note
I am a note box
:::

:::tip
I am a tip box
:::

:::caution
I am a warning box
:::

:::danger
I am an attention box
:::

By default, their headers appear in English even in the translated docs.

You can have the headers translated in the docs in your language by changing the file `docs/index.html`, in this way:

Inside the `script` element there is an object, find the `flexibleAlerts` property, which has this shape:

```js
flexibleAlerts: {
  note: {
    label: {
      '/': 'Note'
    }
  },
  tip: {
    label: {
      '/': 'Tip'
    }
  },
  warning: {
    label: {
      '/': 'Warning'
    }
  },
  attention: {
    label: {
      '/': 'Attention'
    }
  }
}
```

Inside the object of the label property, before the `'/'` property, you would add a new property for your language, like `/i18n/<language>/`.

For example, adding the translations for Portuguese would appear like this:

```js
flexibleAlerts: {
  note: {
    label: {
      '/i18n/portuguese/': 'Observação',
      '/': 'Note'
    }
  },
  tip: {
    label: {
      '/i18n/portuguese/': 'Dica',
      '/': 'Tip'
    }
  },
  warning: {
    label: {
      '/i18n/portuguese/': 'Aviso',
      '/': 'Warning'
    }
  },
  attention: {
    label: {
      '/i18n/portuguese/': 'Atenção',
      '/': 'Attention'
    }
  }
}
```

## How to Translate the Motivational Quotes

The motivational quotes can be found in the [curriculum repository](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/) in the `/client/i18n/locales/<language>/motivation.json` file.

This file has a general structure of:

```json
{
  "compliments": [],
  "motivationalQuotes": []
}
```

The compliments are the short sentences that appear at the completion of a challenge.

You don't need to directly translate the sentences used in English, you can write a set of short sentences that are appropriate to show at the completion of a challenge.

The `compliments` array is an array of strings. So, for example, you would write:

```json
{
  "compliments": ["A tutta birra!", "Pikachu, scelgo te!"],
  "motivationalQuotes": []
}
```

:::tip
You should start with at least a dozen compliments to have some variety when users complete challenges.
:::

The motivational quotes are the quotes that appear at https://freecodecamp.org/learn.

The `motivationalQuotes` array is an array of objects, these objects should include a `quote` property and an `author` property. like this:

```json
{
  "compliments": [],
  "motivationalQuotes": [
    {
      "quote": "Se i costruttori costruissero come i programmatori programmano, il primo picchio che passa potrebbe distruggere la civiltà.",
      "author": "Artur Bloch, Seconda legge di Weinberg"
    },
    {
      "quote": "I bravi programmatori sanno cosa scrivere. I migliori sanno cosa riscrivere.",
      "author": "Eric Steven Raymond"
    }
  ]
}
```

:::tip
You should start with at least a dozen quotes, to have some variety. A new quote is shown every time the user reloads the page.
:::

## How to Update the Common Links

We maintain a file of common links used throughout our [curriculum site](https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp) in the `/client/i18n/locales/<language>/links.json` file.

Some of these links will not change - but you should update the `/news` article links to point to your language's translated version of that article when it is published.

You should also update the `help` categories to point to your language's subforum (usually `language/category`, like `Italiano/HTML-CSS`). This will allow campers to create "help posts" in the correct forum location.

## How to Update the Site Meta-Data

The site meta-data is in the `/client/i18n/locales/<language>/meta-tags.json` file. This file has five keys: `title`, `description`, `social-description`, `keywords`, and `youre-unsubscribed`.

The `youre-unsubscribed` value should be directly translated. The other values will need to be translated as closely as possible, while also considering common search terms and phrases used in your language.

If you need help with this, reach out to us in the [contributor chat](https://discord.gg/PRyKn3Vbay)

## Pre-Translate Workflow on Crowdin

The Pre-Translate workflow can be used to apply translations from the Translation Memory to strings.

:::tip
Really useful to restore a lot of translations from the Translation Memory in bulk when a lot of files have been updated.
:::

You can find the Pre-Translation workflow at the top of the page in the console of a project.
If you see "Go to console" in the upper right corner, click there first.

![go to console button](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/images/crowdin/pre-translate2.png)

![pre-translate workflow](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/images/crowdin/pre-translate1.png)

You can choose "From Machine Translation" or "From Translation Memory". Choose "Translation Memory" to recover translations from memory.

Then there are three steps to complete:

1. Files. Choose which files to translate, you can do all the projects, or specific folders or files.
2. Languages. Set your language here.
3. Existing Translations. The best combination here is "100% match" and "Apply to untranslated strings only". Do not approve automatically, as it's always best to have a human eye on things.

![pre-translate existing translations](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/images/crowdin/pre-translate3.png)

When you have finished setting this, press the Pre-Translate button and wait. It will alert you once it has finished. The time it takes depends on how many untranslated strings are in the chosen files.

## How to Update Crowdin Glossary

:::tip
An updated glossary helps in having a homogeneous translation of technical terms.
:::

The Crowdin Glossary is kept in the [crowdin-glossaries](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/crowdin-glossaries) repository.

In the `glossaries` folder, there are various `*.csv` (comma,separated values) files, one for each of the crowdin projects that have a glossary that can be updated from this workflow.

The `client.csv` file is for the Learn User Interface project, the `curriculum.csv` file is for the Coding Curriculum project, the `docs.csv` file is for the Contributing Documentation project.

To update the Crowdin Glossaries, you need to clone this repo locally. Open the `.csv` file with an appropriate program, for example, Microsoft Excel.

In the `.csv` file you will find that the English language occupies the first three columns, `Term:English` is the column for the English term, `Description:English` is the column for the English description, and `Part:English` is for the part of speech (e.g., noun, verb etc.) of the term.

Then, each target language has two columns. If you translate to Dothraki, you will be interested in the columns `Term:Dothraki` and `Description:Dothraki`. The column `Term:Dothraki` is for the translation of the term in Dothraki, and the column `Description:Dothraki` is for a description of the term in Dothraki.

:::tip
In programs like Microsoft Excel, you can hide the columns of the other languages to free up screen real-estate and see the English columns and the target language columns near each other.
:::

After you have made the changes and saved the file, you will need to make a PR with the proposed changes. After the PR is accepted, you will need to run the GitHub Action workflow to update the Crowdin Glossary. Your glossary changes will not have immediate effects, but they will come.

## How to Promote a Contributor to Proofreader

If you consider that a contributor could become a Crowdin Proofreader, you can give the proofreader role to them this way:

In Crowdin, individuate the `User management` on the left-hand side menu.

This will open the user management tools, you will be able to see the list of all the users.

Search for the user who will become a proofreader. Use the three dots menu on the user row to open a menu and select "Add to team". The proofreader teams have a standard name of `Proof Readers (<language>)`, you can search the team using the language name. Once you have selected the team, use the "ADD" button at the bottom of the page to finalize the thing.

The user is now a proofreader.

:::tip
The newly promoted proofreader could benefit from reading the [How to Proofread Files](/how-to-proofread-files/) documentation.
:::

## How to Add or Update a Language

Check out the [how to enable new language](/how-to-enable-new-languages/) docs. If you are updating a language the section on [set translated superblocks](/how-to-enable-new-languages/#set-translated-superblocks) should be helpful.
