Some email workflows require the back-end API server to send outgoing emails. [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) is a developer tool for email testing that will catch the email messages sent by local API server, without needing to set up any email server.

### Scenarios that send emails

- **Update email**: Users changing their email address
- **Report user**: Abuse reports that notify moderators
- **Certifications**: Certificate verification emails

## Using Mailpit

Mailpit is automatically included when you run `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d` as part of the local setup. No additional installation is required.

Once the containers are running, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025) to access the Mailpit web interface where you can view all emails sent by your local freeCodeCamp instance.

## Troubleshooting

**Emails not appearing?**

1. Check containers are running: `docker ps`
2. Verify Mailpit is listed and healthy
3. Check API logs for email sending errors
4. Restart containers: `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml restart mailpit`

**Can't access the UI?**

- Ensure port 8025 isn't in use by another service
- Try [http://127.0.0.1:8025](http://127.0.0.1:8025) instead of localhost
