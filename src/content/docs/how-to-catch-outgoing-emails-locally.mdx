## Introduction

Some email workflows, like updating a user's email, require the back-end API server to send outgoing emails. MailHog is an alternative to using an email service provider to send actual email messages. It is a developer tool for email testing that will catch the email messages sent by your freeCodeCamp instance.

## Installing MailHog

MailHog can be installed on macOS, Windows, and Linux or used via Docker.

<details>
  <summary>Installing MailHog with Docker</summary>

If you have Docker installed then you can use

```bash
docker run --name mailhog -d -e "MH_STORAGE=maildir" -v $PWD/maildir:/maildir -p 1025:1025 -p 8025:8025 mailhog/mailhog
```

to start MailHog in the background and

```bash
docker stop mailhog
```

to stop it.

When the installation completes, you can start [using MailHog](#using-mailhog).

<details>
<summary>Installing MailHog on macOS</summary>

Install MailHog on macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install mailhog
brew services start mailhog
```

The above commands will start a MailHog service in the background.

When the installation completes, you can start [using MailHog](#using-mailhog).

<summary>Installing MailHog on Windows</summary>

Download the latest version of MailHog from [MailHog's official repository](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog/releases). Locate and click on the link for your Windows version (32 or 64 bit) and a `.exe` file will be downloaded to your computer.

When the download completes, click to open the file. A Windows firewall notification may appear, requesting access permission for MailHog. A standard Windows command line prompt will open where MailHog will be running once firewall access is granted.

Close MailHog by closing the command prompt window. To start MailHog again, click on the MailHog executable (`.exe`) file that was downloaded initially - it is not necessary to download a new MailHog installation file.
