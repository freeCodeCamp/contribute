Follow these guidelines for setting up a development environment for freeCodeCamp. This is highly recommended if you want to contribute regularly.

<Aside type='danger' title='Warning for Windows Users'>

- You can't build and run the codebase on Windows, you will [need to use WSL2](/how-to-setup-wsl/) and then follow the rest of the instructions for Linux or macOS.
- You can't use Windows Command Prompt, Git Bash or PowerShell.
- The hardware requirements need to be better than [what we recommend](/how-to-setup-freecodecamp-locally/#how-to-prepare-your-local-machine) to accommodate for a WSL-based setup.

</Aside>

## Fork the freeCodeCamp repository on GitHub

You will need to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/about-forks) the freeCodeCamp repository on GitHub to get your own copy of the codebase. This will allow you to follow a Git-based workflow to contribute to freeCodeCamp.

**Follow these steps to fork the repository:**

<Steps>

1. Click the button below to fork the freeCodeCamp repository on GitHub.

   <LinkButton
     href='https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/fork'
     icon='seti:github'
     iconPlacement='start'
     variant='secondary'
     target='_blank'
   >
     Fork freeCodeCamp
   </LinkButton>

2. On the create new fork page, check the details and click the **Create fork** button.

3. You should automatically be redirected to your fork, the URL should be something like `https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/freeCodeCamp`.

</Steps>

That's it! You have successfully forked the freeCodeCamp repository. You can always delete your fork if you want to start fresh.

<Aside type='tip' title='Did you know?'>

The main repository at `https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp` is often referred to as the `upstream` repository. Your fork at `https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/freeCodeCamp` is often referred to as the `origin` repository.

</Aside>

## Cloud IDE or your own machine?

Next, you need to choose between setting up a cloud IDE or your own machine.

If you're looking to make a one-time contribution, use Gitpod, GitHub Codespaces, or another cloud-based IDE to make changes. Gitpod sets up a ready-to-code environment in just a few minutes in your web browser. For long-term contributions, we recommend setting up freeCodeCamp on your local machine.

#### Cloud IDE (Gitpod, CodeSpaces, etc.) <Badge text="Recommended" variant="tip" size="small" />

**Pros:**

- No minimum hardware requirements.
- No need to install any software.
- Always up-to-date repository.
- Easy to setup, you only need a browser—including mobile browsers.

**Cons:**

- Requires an internet connection to work.
- Limited free usage—50 hours or so.

#### Your own machine (local setup)

**Pros:**

- Quicker to make changes and see them live (depending on machine capabilities).
- Minimal internet connection required once set up.

**Cons:**

- Powerful minimum hardware requirements.
- Additional software needed.
- Larger download and setup time.

### How to prepare a Cloud IDE

<Aside type='note'>

Skip to [how to prepare your local machine](#how-to-prepare-your-local-machine) if you are not interested in using a cloud IDE.

</Aside>

#### Gitpod

We have automated the process of installing all the dependencies & tools you will need. With Gitpod you get a free ready-to-code environment in a few minutes, and is useful if you do not have access to a computer or want to make one-time changes.

**There are various ways to launch a Gitpod workspace:**

<Steps>

1. Prepend `gitpod.io/#` in front of any URL from GitHub.

   Visit your fork at `https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/freeCodeCamp.git` add `gitpod.io/#` in the front of the URL in the address bar and hit enter.

   In summary, go to

   ```
   gitpod.io/#https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/freeCodeCamp.git
   ```

   and you should see a workspace created for you. This works for any repository or pull-request on GitHub.

2. Alternatively install one of the below extensions for your browser.

   - [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-always-ready-to-co/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) - works with Chromium-based browsers like Google Chrome, Brave, Edge, etc.
   - [Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gitpod) - Firefox

   Once installed you will see a 'Gitpod' button on every repository, pull-request, etc. as a handy shortcut to launch a workspace from there. See the extension page for details, screenshots, etc.

</Steps>

<Aside type='note' title='GitPod is ready!'>

That's it, you can now skip to the [syncing up from parent](#set-up-syncing-from-parent) section after you have launched a Gitpod workspace.

Most parts of this guide applies to Gitpod workspaces, make sure to check the [troubleshooting section](/troubleshooting-development-issues/) for any gotchas.

### How to prepare your local machine

<Aside type='note'>

Skip to [how to prepare a cloud IDE](#how-to-prepare-a-cloud-ide) if you are not interested in setting up a local machine.

</Aside>

<Card title='System Requirements' icon='laptop'>

Here is a minimum system requirement for running freeCodeCamp locally:

- A fast CPU (4+ cores)
- At least 8 GB RAM
- macOS, Linux or Windows 10 or 11 ([with WSL](/how-to-setup-wsl/))
- 8-10 GB of free disk space
- (Optional) 30-50 Mbps internet connection

</Card>

We primarily support development on Linux and Unix-based systems like Ubuntu and macOS. You can develop on Windows 10 or 11 with WSL2 only. You can follow [this guide](/how-to-setup-wsl/) to set up WSL2. You can't use Command Prompt, Git Bash or PowerShell to run freeCodeCamp natively within windows.

Start by installing the prerequisite software for your operating system.

#### Prerequisites:

| Prerequisite                                                                                  | Version | Notes                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)                                                                  | `20.x`  | We use the "Active LTS" version, see [LTS Schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/). |
| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)                                                          | `9.x`   | -                                                                                           |
| [MongoDB Community Server](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) | `6.0.x` | -                                                                                           |

<Aside type='caution' title='Did you check the version?'>

If you have a different version of a requisite software, please install the recommended version. See the [troubleshooting section](/troubleshooting-development-issues/) for more details.

</Aside>

**Run the following commands to validate the versions:**

```bash
node -v
```

```bash
pnpm -v
```

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you need to prepare your development environment. This is common for many development workflows, and you will only need to do this once.

#### Additional Prerequisites:

<Steps>

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or your favorite Git client, if you haven't already. Update to the latest version; the version that came bundled with your OS may be outdated.

2. (Optional but recommended) [Set up an SSH Key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/) for GitHub.

3. Install a code editor of your choice. If you aren't sure which one to use, we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) — it's free and open source.

4. Set up linting for your code editor.

   You should have [ESLint running in your editor](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations.html), and it will highlight anything that doesn't conform to [freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Style Guide](http://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/free-code-camp-javascript-style-guide/19121).

   <Aside type='tip' title='Pay Attention to errors'>

   Please do not ignore any linting errors. They are meant to **help** you and to ensure a clean and simple codebase.

   </Aside>

</Steps>

## Clone your Fork from GitHub

You should already have a fork of freeCodeCamp on GitHub. If not, [follow these instructions to fork the repository](/how-to-setup-freecodecamp-locally/#fork-the-freecodecamp-repository-on-github). Next, you will need to [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork to your local machine.

**Run these commands on your local machine:**

<Steps>

1. Open a terminal in your projects directory, for example:

   ```
   /home/username/projects/
   ```

2. Clone your fork of freeCodeCamp, replacing `YOUR_USER_NAME` with your GitHub Username

   ```bash
   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/freeCodeCamp.git
   ```

   This will download the entire freeCodeCamp repository to your projects directory.

   <Aside type='note'>
     `--depth=1` creates a shallow clone of your fork, with files from the most
     recent history/commit.
   </Aside>

3. **(Optional)** The localized versions of our curriculum are stored in the [i18n-curriculum repo.](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/i18n-curriculum) If you intend to run a localized version of the curriculum follow the next steps, or skip to the next section.

   **Clone the i18n-curriculum submodule:**

   ```bash
   cd freeCodeCamp
   ```

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init
   ```

</Steps>

## Set up Syncing from Parent

Now that you have downloaded a copy of your fork, you will need to set up an `upstream` remote to the parent repository.

[As mentioned earlier](#fork-the-repository-on-github), the main repository is referred to as the `upstream` repository. Your fork is referred to as the `origin` repository.

You need a reference from your local clone to the `upstream` repository in addition to the `origin` repository. This is so that you can sync changes from the main repository without the requirement of forking and cloning repeatedly.

<Steps>

1. Change the directory to the new freeCodeCamp directory if you aren't already there:

   ```bash
   cd freeCodeCamp
   ```

2. Add a remote reference to the main freeCodeCamp repository:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp.git
   ```

3. Ensure the configuration looks correct:

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

   The output should look something like below (replacing `YOUR_USER_NAME` with your GitHub username):

   ```
   origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/freeCodeCamp.git (fetch)
   origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/freeCodeCamp.git (push)
   upstream    https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp.git (fetch)
   upstream    https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp.git (push)
   ```

</Steps>

## Running freeCodeCamp Locally

Now that you have a local copy of freeCodeCamp, you can follow these instructions to run it locally. This will allow you to:

- Preview edits to pages as they would appear on the learning platform.
- Work on UI related issues and enhancements.
- Debug and fix issues with the application servers and client apps.

### Step 1: Set up the Environment Variable File

The default API keys and environment variables are stored in the file `sample.env`. This file needs to be copied to a new file named `.env` that is accessed dynamically during the installation step.

```bash
cp sample.env .env
```

The keys in the `.env` file are _not_ required to be changed to run the app locally. You can leave the default values copied over from `sample.env` as-is.

<Aside type='note'>

Keep in mind if you want to use services like Auth0 or Algolia, you'll have to acquire your own API keys for those services and edit the entries accordingly in the `.env` file.

</Aside>

### Step 2: Install Dependencies & Shared Config

Install the dependencies and set up shared configuration for services.

```bash
pnpm install
```

```bash
pnpm run create:shared
```

### Step 3: Start MongoDB and Seed the Database

Before you can run the application locally, you will need to start the MongoDB Server.

<Steps>

1. Start the MongoDB server in a separate terminal:

   ```bash
   mongod
   ```

   If you kill this terminal session, the MongoDB server will stop.

2. Seed the database and setup a new user:

   <Aside type='note' title='MongoDB URI'>

   The default should be fine for most users. If you are using a custom config, modify the `MONGOHQ_URL` in the `.env` file as needed.

   </Aside>

   ```bash
   pnpm run seed
   ```

   This will set up a new user without any completed certifications among other things. This is usually more than enough to get you started.

3. **(Optional)** Setup a user with completed certifications:

   ```bash
   pnpm run seed:certified-user
   ```

   This comes handy with advanced debugging or creating tests for the platform.

   <Aside type='caution' title='Clear the cookies'>

   You will have to clear your browser cookies and sign in again after seeding the certified user.

   </Aside>

</Steps>

<Card title='Notes on the Database' icon='seti:db'>
  <Aside type='tip' title='Install MongoDB as a background service'>
    You can avoid having to start MongoDB every time by installing it as a
    background service. You can [learn more about it in their documentation for
    your OS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/).
  </Aside>
</Card>

### Step 4: Start the Client App and API Server

You can now start up the API server and the client applications.

```bash
pnpm run develop

```

Once ready, open a web browser and visit: `http://localhost:8000`

<LinkButton
  href='http://localhost:8000'
  icon='external'
  variant='secondary'
  target='_blank'
>
  `http://localhost:8000`
</LinkButton>

<Aside type='tip' title="Congratulations - you're all set!">

If the app loads, sign in. You now have a copy of freeCodeCamp's entire learning platform running on your local machine. Go ahead and start making changes to the codebase.

</Aside>

**Some notes:**

- The API server serves endpoints at `http://localhost:3000`.
- The Gatsby app serves the client application at `http://localhost:8000`.
- All the APIs are available at `http://localhost:3000/explorer`.

<Aside type='note'>
