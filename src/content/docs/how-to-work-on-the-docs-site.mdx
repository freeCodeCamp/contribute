Welcome to the guide for contributing to freeCodeCamp's documentation site! This site is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) with the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) theme and deployed on Cloudflare Pages.

Follow these guidelines for setting up a development environment for the freeCodeCamp documentation site. This is highly recommended if you want to contribute regularly to our contributing guidelines.

### Fork the contribute repository on GitHub

You will need to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/about-forks) the contribute repository on GitHub to get your own copy of the codebase. This will allow you to follow a Git-based workflow to contribute to freeCodeCamp's documentation.

**Follow these steps to fork the repository:**

<Steps>

1. Click the button below to fork the contribute repository on GitHub.

   <LinkButton
     href='https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/contribute/fork'
     icon='seti:github'
     iconPlacement='start'
     variant='secondary'
     target='_blank'
   >
     Fork "freeCodeCamp/contribute"
   </LinkButton>

2. On the create new fork page, check the details and click the **Create fork** button.

3. You should automatically be redirected to your fork, the URL should be something like `https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/contribute`.

</Steps>

That's it! You have successfully forked the contribute repository. You can always delete your fork if you want to start fresh.

<Aside type='tip' title='Did you know?'>

The main repository at `https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/contribute` is often referred to as the `upstream` repository. Your fork at `https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/contribute` is often referred to as the `origin` repository.

</Aside>

### Clone your Fork from GitHub

Next, you will need to [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork to your local machine.

**Run these commands on your local machine:**

<Steps>

1. Open a terminal in your projects directory, for example:

   ```
   /home/username/projects/
   ```

2. Clone your fork of the contribute repository, replacing `YOUR_USER_NAME` with your GitHub Username

   ```bash
   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/contribute.git
   ```

   This will download the entire contribute repository to your projects directory.

   <Aside type='note'>
     `--depth=1` creates a shallow clone of your fork, with files from the most
     recent history/commit.
   </Aside>

</Steps>

### Set up Syncing from Parent

Now that you have downloaded a copy of your fork, you will need to set up an `upstream` remote to the parent repository.

[As mentioned earlier](#fork-the-contribute-repository-on-github), the main repository is referred to as the `upstream` repository. Your fork is referred to as the `origin` repository.

You need a reference from your local clone to the `upstream` repository in addition to the `origin` repository. This is so that you can sync changes from the main repository without the requirement of forking and cloning repeatedly.

<Steps>

1. Change the directory to the new contribute directory:

   ```bash
   cd contribute
   ```

2. Add a remote reference to the main contribute repository:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/contribute.git
   ```

3. Ensure the configuration looks correct:

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

   The output should look something like below (replacing `YOUR_USER_NAME` with your GitHub username):

   ```
   origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/contribute.git (fetch)
   origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/contribute.git (push)
   upstream    https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/contribute.git (fetch)
   upstream    https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/contribute.git (push)
   ```

</Steps>

### Create a Working Branch

Before making any changes, it's important to create a new branch for your work. This keeps your changes organized and separate from the main codebase.

<Steps>

1. Create and switch to a new branch, replacing `feature/your-feature-name` with a descriptive name for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Ensure you are on your new branch:

   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

   You should see your new branch name with an asterisk (\*) next to it, indicating it's the active branch.

</Steps>

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- pnpm v10 (required - do not use npm or yarn)

## Core Development Commands

```bash
# Install pnpm globally if not already installed
npm install -g pnpm

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server (localhost:4321)
pnpm develop

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Build and preview locally using Cloudflare Pages
pnpm preview
```

## Code Quality Commands

```bash
# Run Prettier and ESLint checks
pnpm lint

# Auto-fix Prettier and ESLint issues
pnpm format

# Install Git hooks (runs automatically on install)
pnpm prepare
```

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests once
pnpm test

# Update test snapshots
pnpm test:update

# Run a specific test file
npx vitest run tests/homepage.test.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern
npx vitest run -t "has correct title"
```

## Working on Documentation Content

To work on the contributing guidelines, you can edit or add files in the `src/content/docs` directory [available here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/contribute/tree/main/src/content/docs). When your changes are merged, they will be made available automatically at the documentation site.

When adding a new file to the `docs` directory, you should evaluate if the file should also be added to the sidebar navigation. We typically create a link in the [`src/sidebar.ts`](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/contribute/blob/main/src/sidebar.ts) file for new and independent guides.

### Creating Internal Links

If you want to create a link targeting a different section of the contributing guidelines, follow this format:

```md
[Link text](/target-file-name#target-section-heading-id)

// If the target section is within the same page, you can omit the file name
[Link text](#target-section-heading-id)
```

This is necessary to make these links work for the translated version of the document. Otherwise, they will redirect to the English version of the page regardless of the language.

#### Translating Docs with Internal Links

When you work on translating docs on Crowdin, make sure to replace the `#target-section-heading-id` with the id on the translated document. [Learn more about translating files here](/how-to-translate-files/#translate-documentation).

## Structure of the Docs Website

The site is generated using Astro and served using Cloudflare Pages. Here's how it works:

- All documentation content is stored in `src/content/docs/` as MDX files
- The sidebar navigation is configured in `src/sidebar.ts`
- Site configuration is managed in `astro.config.ts`
- The site is automatically built and deployed via Cloudflare Pages

### Serving the Documentation Site Locally

The documentation site can be served locally using the development command:

```bash
pnpm develop
```

The documentation site should be available at `http://localhost:4321`

## Deployment

The site is deployed on Cloudflare Pages. Please check the wrangler config for deployment details.
