:::note[When do you need this guide?]
You'll need this guide if you're contributing to this documentation site (freeCodeCamp's contributing guides). If you're working on curriculum challenges or the learning platform, you can safely skip this guide.
:::

Follow these guidelines for setting up a development environment for the freeCodeCamp documentation site. This is highly recommended if you want to contribute regularly to our contributing guidelines.

## Fork the contribute repository on GitHub

You will need to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/about-forks) the contribute repository on GitHub to get your own copy of the codebase. This will allow you to follow a Git-based workflow to contribute to freeCodeCamp's documentation.

**Follow these steps to fork the repository:**

<Steps>

1. Click the button below to fork the contribute repository on GitHub.

   <LinkButton
     href='https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/contribute/fork'
     icon='seti:github'
     iconPlacement='start'
     variant='secondary'
     target='_blank'
   >
     Fork "freeCodeCamp/contribute"
   </LinkButton>

2. On the create new fork page, check the details and click the **Create fork** button.

3. You should automatically be redirected to your fork, the URL should be something like `https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/contribute`.

</Steps>

That's it! You have successfully forked the contribute repository.

<Aside type='tip' title='Did you know?'>

The main repository at `https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/contribute` is often referred to as the `upstream` repository. Your fork at `https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/contribute` is often referred to as the `origin` repository.

## Cloud IDE or your own machine?

Next, you need to choose between setting up a cloud IDE or your own machine.

If you're looking to make a one-time contribution or want the fastest setup, use GitHub Codespaces which provides a ready-to-code environment in your web browser using devcontainers. For long-term contributions where you prefer local development, you can set up the documentation site on your local machine.

| Feature                     | GitHub Codespaces <Badge text="Recommended" variant="tip" size="small" /> | Your own machine                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Hardware requirements**   | No minimum hardware requirements                                          | Minimum hardware requirements (Node.js, pnpm)    |
| **Software installation**   | No need to install any software                                           | Additional software needed                       |
| **Repository status**       | Always up-to-date repository                                              | Manual updates required                          |
| **Setup complexity**        | Easy setup with devcontainers, works in any browser                       | Larger download and setup time                   |
| **Internet dependency**     | Requires an internet connection to work                                   | Minimal internet connection required once set up |
| **Performance**             | Consistent cloud-based performance                                        | Depends on your machine capabilities             |
| **Usage limits**            | 60 hours free per month for personal accounts                             | No usage limits                                  |
| **Environment consistency** | Identical setup for all contributors via devcontainers                    | May vary between different machines and OS       |

Once you have decided, follow the relevant tab below to continue with the setup.

<TabItem label="GitHub Codespaces" icon="seti:github">

#### GitHub Codespaces

We have automated the development environment setup using devcontainers. With GitHub Codespaces, you get a consistent, ready-to-code environment that runs in your browser with all dependencies pre-installed.

**Launch a Codespace from your fork:**

<Steps>

1. Go to your fork at `https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/contribute`

2. Click the green **Code** button

3. Select the **Codespaces** tab

4. Click **Create codespace on main**

   Your codespace will automatically set up the development environment using our devcontainer configuration. This includes:
   - Installing Node.js, pnpm, and all dependencies
   - Configuring VS Code extensions
   - Preparing the environment

5. Wait for the setup to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

</Steps>

**Start the development server:**

Once your Codespace is ready, the development server should start automatically. If not, you can start it manually:

```bash
pnpm develop
```

Once ready, you will see a notification to open the site. Click on the notification to open the client application in a new browser tab.

<Aside type='tip' title="Congratulations - you're all set!">

You now have a copy of freeCodeCamp's documentation site running in your Codespace. Go ahead and start making changes to the documentation.

## Prerequisites

<Card title='System Requirements' icon='laptop'>

| Prerequisite                         | Version | Notes                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)         | `22.x`  | We use the "Active LTS" version |
| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) | `10.x`  |                                 |

</Card>

<Aside type='caution' title='Did you check the version?'>

If you have a different version installed, please install the recommended version. You can check your versions by running `node -v` and `pnpm -v` in your terminal.

</Aside>

**Run the following commands to validate the versions:**

```bash
node -v
```

```bash
pnpm -v
```

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you need to prepare your development environment. This is common for many development workflows, and you will only need to do this once.

## Additional Prerequisites

<Steps>

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or your favorite Git client, if you haven't already. Update to the latest version; the version that came bundled with your OS may be outdated.

2. (Optional but recommended) [Set up an SSH Key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/) for GitHub.

3. Install a code editor of your choice. If you aren't sure which one to use, we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) — it's free and open source.

4. Set up linting for your code editor.

   You should have [ESLint running in your editor](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations.html), and it will highlight anything that doesn't conform to [freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Style Guide](http://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/free-code-camp-javascript-style-guide/19121).

   <Aside type='tip' title='Pay Attention to errors'>

   Please do not ignore any linting errors. They are meant to **help** you and to ensure a clean and simple codebase.

   </Aside>

</Steps>

## Clone your Fork from GitHub

Next, you will need to [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork to your local machine.

**Run these commands on your local machine:**

<Steps>

1. Open a terminal in your projects directory, for example:

   ```
   /home/username/projects/
   ```

2. Clone your fork of the contribute repository, replacing `YOUR_USER_NAME` with your GitHub Username

   ```bash
   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/contribute.git
   ```

   This will download the entire contribute repository to your projects directory.

   <Aside type='note'>
     `--depth=1` creates a shallow clone of your fork, with files from the most
     recent history/commit.
   </Aside>

</Steps>

## Set up Syncing from Parent

Now that you have downloaded a copy of your fork, you will need to set up an `upstream` remote to the parent repository.

[As mentioned earlier](#fork-the-contribute-repository-on-github), the main repository is referred to as the `upstream` repository. Your fork is referred to as the `origin` repository.

You need a reference from your local clone to the `upstream` repository in addition to the `origin` repository. This is so that you can sync changes from the main repository without the requirement of forking and cloning repeatedly.

<Steps>

1. Change the directory to the new contribute directory:

   ```bash
   cd contribute
   ```

2. Add a remote reference to the main contribute repository:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/contribute.git
   ```

3. Ensure the configuration looks correct:

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

   The output should look something like below (replacing `YOUR_USER_NAME` with your GitHub username):

   ```
   origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/contribute.git (fetch)
   origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/contribute.git (push)
   upstream    https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/contribute.git (fetch)
   upstream    https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/contribute.git (push)
   ```

</Steps>

## Install Dependencies

First, ensure you have pnpm installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will install all required dependencies and set up Git hooks automatically.

## Start the Development Server

You can now start up the development server:

```bash
pnpm develop
```

Once ready, open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:4321`:

<LinkButton
  href='http://localhost:4321'
  icon='external'
  variant='secondary'
  target='_blank'
>
  `http://localhost:4321`
</LinkButton>

<Aside type='tip' title="Congratulations - you're all set!">

You now have a copy of freeCodeCamp's documentation site running on your local machine. Go ahead and start making changes to the documentation.

</Aside>

<Aside type='note'>

If you have issues with the setup or need to run other commands like linting, testing, or building for production, check the [Quick Commands Reference](#quick-commands-reference) at the end of this guide.

</Tabs>

## Create a Working Branch

Before making any changes, it's important to create a new branch for your work. This keeps your changes organized and separate from the main codebase.

<Steps>

1. Create and switch to a new branch, replacing `feature/your-feature-name` with a descriptive name for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Ensure you are on your new branch:

   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

   You should see your new branch name with an asterisk (\*) next to it, indicating it's the active branch.

</Steps>

## Working on Documentation Content

You can edit or add files in the `src/content/docs` directory [available here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/contribute/tree/main/src/content/docs). When your changes are merged, they will be made available automatically at the documentation site.

<Aside type='note'>

When adding a new file to the `docs` directory, you should evaluate if the file should also be added to the sidebar navigation. We typically create a link in the [`src/sidebar.ts`](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/contribute/blob/main/src/sidebar.ts) file for new and independent guides.

</Aside>

### Creating Internal Links

If you want to create a link targeting a different section of the contributing guidelines, follow this format:

```md
[Link text](/target-file-name#target-section-heading-id)

// If the target section is within the same page, you can omit the file name
[Link text](#target-section-heading-id)
```

This is necessary to make these links work for the translated version of the document. Otherwise, they will redirect to the English version of the page regardless of the language.

## Structure of the Docs Website

The site is generated using Astro and served using Cloudflare Workers. Here's how it works:

<Card title='Key Architecture' icon='seti:config'>

- All documentation content is stored in `src/content/docs/` as MDX files
- The sidebar navigation is configured in `src/sidebar.ts`
- Site configuration is managed in `astro.config.ts`
- The site is automatically built and deployed via Cloudflare Workers

</Card>

## Deployment

The site is deployed on Cloudflare Workers. Please check the wrangler config for deployment details.
