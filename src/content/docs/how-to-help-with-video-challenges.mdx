A video challenge is a small section of a full-length video course on a particular topic. A video challenge page embeds a YouTube video. Each challenge page has a single multiple-choice question related to the video. A user must answer the question correctly before moving on to the next video challenge in the course.

The video challenge pages are created by members of the freeCodeCamp team. YouTube videos are also uploaded by members of the freeCodeCamp team.

## Creating Questions for Video Challenges

First, find the `videoId`.

For example, in the following code from the header of a video challenge markdown file, the `videoId` is "nVAaxZ34khk". On GitHub, the information should be laid out in a table format.

sidebar:
  label: "Work on Video Challenges"
challengeType: 11
videoId: nVAaxZ34khk
---
```

Next, access the YouTube video with that `videoId`. The URL for the video will be:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=[videoId] (replace `videoId` in the URL with the video's ID - without square brackets)

In the example above, the URL is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVAaxZ34khk

Skim the YouTube video with that `videoId` and think of a multiple-choice question based on the content of the video.
