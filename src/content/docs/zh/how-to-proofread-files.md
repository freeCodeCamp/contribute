title: 如何校对译文
---

Our proofreading team is responsible for ensuring that translations accurately reflect the source text. We trust our proofreaders to ensure that we have very high quality translations.

All our translations are done by hand, by real humans. Proofreading ensures that there is a consistent tone across all our translated resources like the curriculum.

To begin proofreading, visit [our translation platform](https://translate.freecodecamp.org) and login. Select "Go to console" in the top navigation bar to switch from the public view to the workspace view.

## 选择文件

You should see the list of projects you have been granted access to. Select the project that you would like to proofread, then select the language.

You should now see the list of available files. Choose your file by selecting the `Proofread` button on the right of that file, then choosing `Proofreading` from the drop-down menu that appears.

> [!NOTE] If you are in this workspace view, but want to work on [translating a file](how-to-translate-files) instead of proofreading, you may select `Crowdsourcing` from the dropdown menu instead.

Here you will see the list of strings in the selected file, with their related translations. The translation that is displayed here is the translation that has received the highest score (between upvotes and downvotes) from the translation community.

While you can view _all_ proposed translations for a given string, the community scores (determined by the upvotes and downvotes) should be taken into consideration when choosing which translation to approve. The community can review proposed translations and recommend which one is most accurate and clear.

1. 这是源文件的字符串（英文）。
2. 这是相匹配的翻译的字符串。 此处将显示基于赞同和反对票数的最受欢迎的译文建议。
3. 点击这个选择标记按钮确认该译文。
4. Crowdin 将显示每个字符串的状态。 `Done` 的意思是已经确认了译文，我们将在下次从 Crowdin 拉取内容的时候下载已确认的译文。 `Todo` 的意思是字符串的译文还未被校对确认。 `Hidden` means the string is locked and _should not be translated_. `Comment` 的意思是对此字符串有评论消息。
5. 可以使用复框选择多条译文，并在此处一次性批量确认。
6. 你可以在此处查看社区建议的译文，社区对其的评分，以及 Crowdin 建议的译文。
7. 这个按钮显示/隐藏右侧的显示窗口，你可以在其中查看翻译、评论、翻译记忆和词汇表术语。
8. Crowdin 在此处显示来自质量保证检查的报错消息。 也就是说，如果译文中有不正确的地方，Crowdin 会通知你。 请仔细校对确认出现报错消息的译文。

No additional actions are required once a file has been proofread.

> [!NOTE] Approving a string in the proofreading view will mark it as complete and it will be downloaded in our next pull from Crowdin to GitHub.

## Becoming a Proofreader

If you have any questions, or are interested in becoming a proofreader, feel free to reach out to us in our [contributors chat room](https://discord.gg/PRyKn3Vbay). We will typically grant you proofreading access if you have been contributing to freeCodeCamp for a while.

Our staff team and community moderators teams are always looking for kind volunteers like you who help us make high quality translations available to the world.

> [!NOTE] Crowdin 会允许你校对你自己的译文。 一般来说，最好是让另一位校对者审核你的译文，以确保最终内容的准确性。

## Creating a Channel on Chat for a World Language

For the most part, we encourage you to use the [contributors chat](https://discord.gg/PRyKn3Vbay) room for all correspondence. However if the team of volunteer translators grows for a certain language, we can consider creating an additional break-out channel for the language.

If you are already a proofreader and are interested in having a dedicated channel on our chat servers for a specific language, [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/XU5CyutrYCgDYaVZA).
