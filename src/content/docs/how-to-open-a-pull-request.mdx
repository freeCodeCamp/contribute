A pull request (PR), enables you to send changes from your fork on GitHub to freeCodeCamp.org's main repository. Once you are done making changes to the code, you can follow these guidelines to open a PR.

We expect our contributors to be familiar with the contribution process specific to this project. Following the guidelines carefully earns you the respect of fellow maintainers and saves everyone time.

Some examples of this are:

<Steps>

1. Do not edit files directly through GitHub – while you can, it's not a good idea.
2. Make sure the PR title follows [our convention](#prepare-a-good-pr-title).
3. Make sure you follow the PR checklist thoughtfully and not just tick things off; this helps reviewers take your contribution seriously.
4. Use the correct way to link issues in the description of the PR by updating the `XXXXXX`. Do not just add issue numbers everywhere and anywhere you feel like.
5. Do not "@mention" or request someone for reviews too many times.

   We understand you are excited about contributing. As much as a maintainer will love to get back to you, they are busy people looking after hundreds of requests just like yours. Be patient, someone will get to you sooner or later.

6. Do not work directly off your `main` branch - create a new branch for the changes you are working on.

</Steps>

:::note
Your PR should be targeting changes to the English curriculum only. Read [this guide](/getting-started/#translations) instead for contributing to translations.

## Prepare a Good PR Title

We use [conventional title and messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commits and pull requests. The convention has the following format:

> `<type>([optional scope(s)]): <description>`
>
> For example:
>
> `fix(learn): tests for the do...while loop challenge`

Whenever you open a Pull Request (PR), you can use the below to determine the type, scope (optional), and description.

**Type:**

| Type     | Description                                                                |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fix      | Bug fixes - when you repair something that wasn't working correctly        |
| feat     | New features - when you add new functionality that didn't exist before     |
| refactor | Code cleanup - reorganizing code without changes to logic                  |
| chore    | Maintenance tasks - updating dependencies, build configs, or project setup |
| docs     | Documentation - updating README files, comments, or help documentation     |

**Scope:**

`Scope` is optional but it helps reviewers understand which areas of the project are impacted. Common scopes include:

- **curriculum**: Lessons, challenges, projects, and learning content
- **ui**: User interface and user experience improvements
- **a11y**: Accessibility improvements and fixes
- **i18n**: Internationalization and language translations
- **api**: Backend API and server-side code
- **client**: Frontend client application code
- **tools**: Development scripts, build tools, and configuration

**Description:**

Keep it short (less than 30 characters) and simple; you can add more information in the PR description box and comments.

Some examples of good PR titles would be:

- `fix(a11y): improved search bar contrast`
- `feat: add more tests to HTML and CSS challenges`
- `fix(api,client): prevent CORS errors on form submission`
- `docs(i18n): fix links to be relative instead of absolute`

## Proposing a Pull Request

<Steps>

1.  Once the edits have been committed, you will be prompted to create a pull request on your fork's GitHub Page.

          <details>

    <summary>See screenshot</summary>

          </details>

2.  By default, all pull requests should be against the freeCodeCamp main repo, `main` branch.

    Make sure that your Base Fork is set to freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp when raising a Pull Request.

          </details>

3.  Submit the pull request from your branch to freeCodeCamp's `main` branch.

4.  Include a more detailed summary of the changes you made and how your changes are helpful in the body of your PR.
    - You will be presented with a pull request template. This is a checklist that you should have followed before opening the pull request.

    - Fill in the details as you see fit. Ensure that you give the reviewers enough context to review the changes. If the PR makes changes to the UI, be sure to include screenshots of the changes as well. All of this information will be reviewed and the reviewers will decide whether or not your pull request is accepted.

    - If the PR is meant to address an existing GitHub Issue then, at the end of
      your PR's description body, use the keyword _Closes_ with the issue number to [automatically close that issue if the PR is accepted and merged](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords).

      > Example: `Closes #123` will close issue 123

5.  Indicate if you have tested on a local copy of the site or not.
    - This is very important when making changes that are not just edits to text content like documentation or a challenge description. Examples of changes that need local testing include JavaScript, CSS, or HTML, which could change the functionality or layout of a page.

    - If your PR affects the behavior of a page, it should be accompanied by corresponding [Playwright integration tests](/how-to-add-playwright-tests/).
