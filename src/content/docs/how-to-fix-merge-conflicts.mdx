## Conflicts on a Pull Request

Conflicts can arise because many contributors work on the repository, and changes can break your PR which is pending a review and merge.

Since we squash all commits, you may not need to do a rebase. However, if a rebase is requested, check our [For Usual Bug Fixes and Features](#for-usual-bug-fixes-and-features) or [For Upcoming Curriculum and Features](#for-upcoming-curriculum-and-features) guides to learn how to do this process for your corresponding PR.

### For Usual Bug Fixes and Features

When you are working on regular bugs and features on our development branch `main`, you are able to do a simple rebase:

<Steps>

1. Rebase your local copy:

   ```bash
   git checkout <pr-branch>
   git pull --rebase upstream main
   ```

2. Resolve any conflicts and add / edit commits

   ```bash
   # Either
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: resolve conflicts"

   # Or
   git add .
   git commit --amend --no-edit
   ```

3. Push back your changes to the PR

   ```bash
   git push --force origin <pr-branch>
   ```

</Steps>

### For Upcoming Curriculum and Features

When you are working on features for our upcoming curriculum `next-*` branches, you have to do a `cherry-pick`:

<Steps>

1. Make sure your upstream comes in sync with your local:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git fetch --all --prune
   git checkout next-python-projects
   git reset --hard upstream/next-python-projects
   ```

2. Take a backup

   a. Either delete your local branch after taking a backup (if you still have it locally):

   ```bash
   git checkout <pr-branch-name>

   # example:
   # git checkout feat/add-numpy-video-question

   git checkout -b <backup-branch-name>

   # example:
   #  git checkout -b backup-feat/add-numpy-video-question

   git branch -D <pr-branch-name>
   ```

   b. Or just a backup of your PR branch (if you do not have it locally):

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <backup-branch-name> origin/<pr-branch-name>

   # example:
   #  git checkout -b backup-feat/add-numpy-video-question origin/feat/add-numpy-video-question
   ```

3. Start off with a clean slate:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <pr-branch-name> next-python-projects
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
   ```

4. Resolve any conflicts, cleanup, and install dependencies and run tests

   ```bash
   pnpm run clean

   pnpm install
   FCC_SUPERBLOCK='<superblock-name>' pnpm run test:curriculum:content

   # example:

   # FCC_SUPERBLOCK='python-for-everybody' pnpm run test:curriculum:content

   ```

5. If everything looks good, push back to the PR

   ```bash
   git push --force origin <pr-branch-name>
   ```

</Steps>
