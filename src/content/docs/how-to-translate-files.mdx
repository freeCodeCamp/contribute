<Aside type='note' title='Announcement'>

We’re exploring new ways to translate freeCodeCamp’s resources into world languages. For now, we’re not accepting contributions to translate our curriculum.

In the meantime, you might consider contributing to [other areas](/getting-started/) that are open for contributions.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us on our [Discord server](https://chat.freecodecamp.org).

Thank you for your patience and understanding.
